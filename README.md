### This is a multi-stage Java project designed and implemented using Object-Oriented Programming, UML modeling, and a Finite State Machine (FSM).

*The system mimics core features of a warehouse environment, including clients, products, wishlists, transactions, and inventory operations.*
  
- Developed collaboratively as part of a four-person team.

- Technologies Used: Java, OOP, UML, State Design Pattern, Finite State Machine (FSM), SOLID Principles.

### 👩‍💻 My Contributions

- Designed the `WishList.java` backend based on a use case I wrote from initial requirements.
- Developed the `WishListMenuState` on top of the WishList backend.
- Implemented the `ManagerMenuState` logic and menu flow.
- Refined and reorganized class designs for consistency and clarity.
- Ensured OOP principles and LSP consistency.
- Improved the logic, reliability, and flow of state transitions within the FSM.

The test flow is outlined in testprocedure.txt to ensure that the program runs successfully.
